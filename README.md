# The Book Project

This repo will contain the resources for a mythical book. The contents will be lessons learnt as an engineer, tips and tricks, methods and tool reviews.

This repo will be used to hold engineering notes, and the draft and work in progress pages for my blog, and website.  Everything here will be raw and unpolished, an may get cleaner with feedback.

The project was kicked off 1st November, 2023; let's see how well I can maintain this.
