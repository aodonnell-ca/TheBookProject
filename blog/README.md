# The Blog Posts

I have decided to write the blog posts in `.md`, and manage them here before release.

Since the articles will go live on `WordPress` I should have no concern about moving the completed ones to the public book page.

> **UPDATE:** There are times I feel the need to work on blog posts outside of WordPress, but most of the time I am working directly in the WordPress web editor.
> Maintaining a copy here would be a prudent back-up, but there are differences in format, especially around image links, so I have mostly abandoned the blog workflow that uses this repo.
>
> The actual blog is currently [glorifiedplumbing.blog](https://glorifiedplumbing.blog).
