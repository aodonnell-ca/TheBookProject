## Stack Edit - a browser based Markdown editor

I've been trying out new tools again. This time I am on the quest to find a text-to-schematic tool, but one thing I also realized is that I also want a real lightweight editor that allows me to just spew words onto the page.

I know in the world of Special Eduction the `AlphaSmart Neo2` was a lightweight portable wordprocessor. It's great value was its distraction free interface, alongside its portability and low power consumption. I have seen a writers talk about it enthusiastically, such as [this post](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/alphasmart-portable-word-processor/). I don't need to be buying new tech right now. I have too much lying around - why is it so hard to throw out an old latop? But I do have a chromebook, that can work off grid and provide a relatively good experience.
